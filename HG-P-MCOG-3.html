          "Today you will read "The Honeyguide's Revenge" for the third time. Afterwards we will ask you to retell the story. 
           It is easier to remember a story if you know that most stories have a similar structure as shown here in this chart.
           A story begins with the <span style="color:red; background-color:white;">exposition</span> - this is the part that introduces the characters and the setting and gets the story started. 
           Then the plot gets going with <span style="color:red; background-color:white;"style="color:red; background-color:white;">rising action</span> - these are the events that lead up to the <span style="color:red; background-color:white;">climax</span>. 
           The rising actions usually involve at least one problem that must be solved. The climax is the point of major tension in the story. 
           After the climax there are falling actions. These are plot events that lead toward the resolution of the problem or the conflict. 
           Finally there is the <span style="color:red; background-color:white;">resolution</span> of the problem. Today when you read the story for the last time you can think about where the events in the story fit into this story arc."
