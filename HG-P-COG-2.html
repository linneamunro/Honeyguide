          "In this story "The Honeyguide's Revenge," Gingele gets honeycomb out of a hive. He uses a smoking stick to calm the bees first. 
          How does the smoking stick work? When there is smoke the bees cannot detect alarm signals that would normally cause them to attack an intruder. 
          Smoke also makes them think there is a forest fire so they eat a lot of honey before leaving their hive to look for a new home. 
          It is hard for them to sting when they are full of honey. "

          searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his head. “Chitik-chitik-chitik,” the little bird rattled, as he flew to the next tree, and the next. 
          <span id="chitik_word">“Chitik, chitik, chitik,”</span> he called, stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed.

          He quickly made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his teeth. Ngede sat and watched.

          But instead of the hive, he was staring into the face of a leopard! Leopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes, opened her
