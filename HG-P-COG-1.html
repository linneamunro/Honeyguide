          "Welcome, my name is Whoo! <br>
          You will read the story "The Honeyguide's Revenge." This story is a folktale told by the Zulu people in Africa. 
          A folktale is a traditional story that is passed down from one generation to another by word of mouth. 
          Folktales usually explain something. Often folktales are a way for older people to teach young people how to survive and prosper in the local environment. 
          South Africa is a large country with a beautiful and varied environment.  After you have read the story you can think about what you have learned about living in Africa."

          searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his head. “Chitik-chitik-chitik,” the little bird rattled, as he flew to the next tree, and the next. 
          <span id="chitik_word">“Chitik, chitik, chitik,”</span> he called, stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed.

        <div class="words">After half an hour, they reached a huge wild fig tree. Ngede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile 
          as if to say, “Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?” Gingile couldn’t see any bees from under the tree, but he

           into the heart of the fire. This wood was especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned. He began climbing, holding the cool end of the

          When Gingile reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow. The bees came rushing out, angry and mean. They flew away because they didn’t

          He put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder, and started to climb down the tree.

          After leading Gingile along the edge of the forest, Ngede stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn. “Ahh,” thought Gingile. “The hive must be in this tree.”
          He quickly made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his teeth. Ngede sat and watched.

          But instead of the hive, he was staring into the face of a leopard! Leopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes, opened her 
          mouth to reveal her very large and very <span id="sharp_word">sharp</span> teeth.
